# Costom-Instruction-Set-processor-

🧠 Project Objective:  To build a simple CPU from scratch with your own custom instruction set architecture (ISA), tailored to a specific application (e.g., calculator, signal processing, controller).

🔍 Why This Project?
Gives you complete control over CPU architecture.
Combines ISA design, RTL implementation, control logic, and system-level integration.
Great for both academic research and FPGA-based embedded system development.
